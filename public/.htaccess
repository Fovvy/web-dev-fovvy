# Basic .htaccess for routing API requests and handling frontend

RewriteEngine On

# Redirect to HTTPS (optional, but good practice for production)
# RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# Serve static files directly if they exist
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

# Route API requests to api/index.php
# Example: /api/rates will be handled by api/index.php
RewriteRule ^api/(.*)$ api/index.php [L,QSA]

# For all other requests, serve index.html (for Single Page Application behavior)
# This ensures that frontend routing can take over if you use a JS framework
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/api
RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
